# Jessy: it is like Alexa, but closer to you

Jessy is based on
[jasperproject.github.io](http://jasperproject.github.io/). However,
since the project has been abandoned and pull requests are stuck there
forever, Jessy came to existence.

Client code for the Jessie voice computing platform. Jessy is an open
source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled
applications. 

Installation process, documentation and other data right now is
identical as on Jasper project:
[jasperproject.github.io](http://jasperproject.github.io/).
